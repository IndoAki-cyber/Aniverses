        Son Goku is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama. He is based on Sun Wukong (known as Son Gokū in Japan and the Monkey King in the West), a main character of the classic 16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West, combined with influences from the Hong Kong action cinema of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee. Goku made his debut in the first Dragon Ball chapter, Bulma and Son Goku, originally published in Japan's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on December 3, 1984.
       Goku is introduced as an eccentric, monkey-tailed boy who practices martial arts and possesses superhuman strength. He meets Bulma and joins her on a journey to find the seven wish-granting Dragon Balls. Along the way, he finds new friends who follow him on his journey to become stronger. As Goku grows up, he becomes the Earth's mightiest warrior and battles a wide variety of villains with the help of his friends and family, while also gaining new allies in the process. Born under the name Kakarot, as a member of the Saiyan race on Planet Vegeta, he is sent to Earth as an infant prior to his homeworld's destruction at the hands of Frieza. Upon his arrival on Earth, the infant is discovered by Son Gohan, who becomes the adoptive grandfather of the boy and gives him the name Goku. The boy is initially full of violence and aggression due to his Saiyan nature, until an accidental head injury turns him into a cheerful, carefree person. Grandpa Gohan's kindness and teachings help to further influence Goku, who later on names his first son Gohan in honor of him.

      <h3 class="char-name">Kazuma Satou</h3>
      <p class="char-role">Magician / Hero</p>
      <p class="char-desc">
        Kazuma Satou is the main protagonist of the light novel, manga and anime series KonoSuba, created by Natsume Akatsuki. He is voiced by Jun Fukushima in Japan and by Arnie Pantoja in English-speaking regions. He was a shut-in NEET until being sent to a parallel world and became the leader of a new party. Initially shown to be cynical and sarcastic, he can show selflessness and compassion towards his friends and competence as a leader. His main goals are to defeat the demon king and his generals, to return to Japan, and to realize the aspects of his new life.
        Kazuma's signature weapon is his sword, and he is more experienced in short-range melee combat. He also uses weapons like his bow, which has precise aim using his "Snipe" skill. Being an adventurer, he is able to learn a variety of other skills from other classes such as Mana Swap, Freeze, Create Water and Steal.[16] These abilities have to usually be taught to him by other characters before he can use them, and he cannot learn advanced skills. Thus, he combines basic skills for more powerful attacks, such as combining his ice and water skills during his rematch with Kyouya Mitsurugi. Statiscally, Kazuma is average in most traits but has above average intelligence and abnormally high luck.[17] Due to this, he nearly put an entire casino into bankruptcy due to his consistent wins.[18] However due to his low-level class, Kazuma is prone to getting slain multiple times in combat against especially powerful opponents, prompting Aqua to revive him.
         Kazuma is also extremely skilled in battle strategy, often finding creative ways to utilise his party's specialised skillsets in order to defeat enemies in the most efficient way possible. When fighting alone, he often uses underhanded tactics to compensate for his lack of raw power, such as creating earth and blowing it in the eyes of his enemies or using "Steal" as a distraction. With the immense wealth that he gathers through the course of the series, he buys more expensive equipment such as high grade manatites to cast stronger spells

      <p class="char-role">Stand User / Hero</p>
      <p class="char-desc">
        Jotaro "JoJo" Kujo is a fictional character in the Japanese manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki. The main protagonist of the series' third story arc, Stardust Crusaders, Jotaro is depicted as a rough delinquent with a noble heart who journeys from Japan to Egypt with his grandfather, Joseph Joestar, and their allies to defeat his great great grandfather's killer, Dio Brando, and save his mother's life. He has a Stand (a physical manifestation of his fighting spirit) named Star Platinum, whose power is incredible strength, speed, and precision. Later, Star Platinum gains the ability Star Platinum: The World , enabling Jotaro to stop time for a few seconds.
         Jotaro returns in subsequent story arcs of the manga as a supporting character. In Diamond Is Unbreakable, he meets his 16-year old biological uncle Josuke Higashikata. Jotaro also appears briefly in Golden Wind when he sends Koichi Hirose to Italy to spy on Dio's son, Giorno Giovanna, and in Stone Ocean to aid his daughter Jolyne Cujoh against the forces of Enrico Pucci. The siblings Yoshikage and Kei Kira take his place in the Joestar family tree in the alternate universe of JoJolion.
